# devtools-checker-block
These are the most common types of DevTool checkers I have seen. This tool can help you get around most of the DevTools checks.

Please note that this tool might break some websites. This tool is designed to help you access the DevTools temporarily, and should not be left enabled after your testing has concluded. If you want to use it on all websites, you might have to comment out some code.
